<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>JavaScript (English: JavaScript) is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used within web browsers and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha at first and later LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript. While JavaScript's syntax is similar to that of Sun Microsystems, this is in fact because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and JavaScript is not directly related. Other than his name and syntax, he has more similarities to himself or Skim than Java.
