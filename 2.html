<h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language[1] that describes how markup languages are actually displayed, mainly in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.
If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of the website, CSS is responsible for decorating like clothes and accessories. In other words, changing the CSS file alone can make it look like a completely different website.
